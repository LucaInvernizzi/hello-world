# hello-world
First GitHub repository

Don't know if I will ever use this one!

This is a very good way to learn how to use github! Cool idea!

I've just started, and the road ahead is long, but who knows, maybe in a couple of year I will be better and I will modify this entry once more!

It's been a lot of fun working on this. Seems a bit silly to put this in a public repo, but getting to work on the computational side of biology has been amazing. Don't know if I will be able to keep going in this field, but let's hope so!
